### Privacy Policy for Actionforge

#### Introduction

Welcome to Actionforge, a visual node system designed to enhance your workflow automation. At Actionforge, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is handled responsibly. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information we collect, how we use it, and the measures we take to safeguard it. This policy also explains our compliance with GDPR and other relevant privacy regulations.

#### Information We Collect

1. **Runtime:**
   - The Actionforge runtime does not collect any telemetry data. This means that no information about your usage of the runtime is transmitted to our servers.

2. **Web Offering:**

    On our website [actionforge.dev](https://actionforge.dev) and in the web app [app.actionforge.dev](https://app.actionforge.dev), we collect the following information:

   - **Error Reporting:**
     - Our web application incorporates error reporting using [Sentry](https://www.sentry.io). Sentry may collect information related to errors and crashes, including stack traces, timestamps, and metadata about your environment. This data helps us diagnose and fix issues to improve the application’s performance and stability.
   - **Google Analytics:**
     - We use Google Analytics to collect information about how visitors use our site. This includes data such as the pages visited, time spent on the site, and the geographic location of the visitor. Google Analytics collects information anonymously and reports website trends without identifying individual visitors.
   - **Non-Personal Information:**
     - We do not collect any personally identifiable information such as names, usernames, or addresses. The information collected by Sentry is used solely for error tracking and debugging purposes.

#### How We Use the Information

- **Improvement of Services:**
  - The data collected through Sentry’s error reporting is used to identify and resolve bugs and other issues, ensuring a better user experience.
- **Security and Maintenance:**
  - Information about errors and crashes helps us maintain the security and integrity of our web application, allowing us to respond quickly to potential threats and vulnerabilities.

#### Data Sharing and Disclosure

- **Third-Party Services:**
  - We use Sentry for error reporting. Sentry’s privacy practices are governed by their own privacy policy, which can be found [here](https://sentry.io/privacy/). We do not share your information with other third parties.
- **Legal Requirements:**
  - We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).

#### Data Security

We take the security of your data seriously. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, loss, or alteration. These measures include encryption, access controls, and regular security assessments.

#### Your Rights

- **Access and Correction:**
  - Since we do not collect personal information, there is no personal data to access or correct. If you have any questions about the data we collect through Sentry, please reach out.
- **Data Deletion:**
  - If you wish to have any data related to error reports deleted, please reach out. We will work with Sentry to fulfill your request in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

### GDPR Compliance and Other Privacy Regulations

Actionforge adheres to GDPR and other relevant privacy regulations by ensuring lawful data processing, data minimization, robust data protection, and respecting users' rights. By integrating Sentry and following its Data Processing Addendum, Actionforge ensures that data handling practices comply with international privacy standards.
