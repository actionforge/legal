# Privacy Policy

### Introduction

Actionforge provides a visual node system designed to enhance workflow automation. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information collected, how that information is utilized, and the measures taken to safeguard it. This policy also explains compliance with GDPR and other relevant privacy regulations.

### Information Collection

#### 1. Actionforge Software (Runtime, Editor, and CLI)

In accordance with the End User License Agreement, the Actionforge Software (including the Web App Editor, Runner Executable, and GitHub Action) collects anonymous technical data ("Telemetry").

* **Purpose:** Telemetry is used to improve and debug the Software.
* **Nature of Data:** This Telemetry does not intentionally include Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or proprietary code logic.

#### 2. Web Offerings

On the website [actionforge.dev](https://actionforge.dev) and the web app [app.actionforge.dev](https://app.actionforge.dev), the following information is processed:

* **PostHog:**
* Actionforge utilizes [PostHog](https://posthog.com) for product analytics and error tracking. PostHog captures anonymous usage statistics, crash reports, and interaction data. This data allows for the identification of bugs and the optimization of user experience.


* **Cloudflare:**
* The web infrastructure utilizes [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) for performance, security, and DNS services. Cloudflare may process data, such as IP addresses and request headers, to detect threats, prevent attacks, and manage network traffic.



### Usage of Information

* **Service Improvement:** Data collected through PostHog allows for the identification and resolution of bugs, crashes, and usability issues.
* **Security and Maintenance:** Information regarding errors and network traffic helps maintain the security and integrity of the application, allowing for rapid responses to potential threats.

### Data Sharing and Disclosure

* **Third-Party Services:**
* **PostHog:** Data is processed by PostHog for analytics and debugging purposes.
* **Cloudflare:** Network traffic data is processed by Cloudflare for security and performance delivery.
* Actionforge does not share data with other third parties unrelated to the operation and security of the service.


* **Legal Requirements:** Information may be disclosed if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.

### Data Security

Appropriate technical and organizational measures are implemented to protect information from unauthorized access, loss, or alteration. These measures include encryption, access controls, and regular security assessments.

### Your Rights

* **Access and Correction:** As the Telemetry collected is anonymous and does not intentionally include PII, specific personal data access or correction requests may not be applicable to the telemetry data.
* **Data Deletion:** Requests to delete specific data related to error reports or analytics may be submitted via the contact email below. Actionforge will work with data processors (PostHog) to fulfill requests in accordance with applicable laws.

### GDPR Compliance

Actionforge adheres to GDPR and other relevant privacy regulations by ensuring lawful data processing, data minimization, and robust data protection. By integrating Cloudflare and PostHog, Actionforge ensures that data handling practices comply with international privacy standards.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Any changes will be posted on this page. Continued use of Actionforge after changes have been made constitutes acceptance of the new Privacy Policy.
